# Real-Time-Mask-Detection-with-CNN
This project utilizes a MobileNet-based CNN with Keras for real-time face mask detection. It captures video from a webcam, processes frames for classification, and displays results in a Streamlit interface. Users can start and stop the video stream, enabling real-time feedback on mask compliance for public health monitoring and enforcement.
